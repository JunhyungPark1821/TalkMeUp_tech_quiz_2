# TalkMeUp_tech_quiz_2


Implement a react single page app that can mashup a 3 X 3 matrix of 7 pictures and 2 videos according to the user entered topic. 
At the beginning, it should only have one input field that waits for user input. The user can input anything, like â€œsunglasses"
Search in internet for 7 pictures and 2 videos that relate with the topic 
Show the preview of the 9 results in a 3 X 3 matrix in the webpage
User can choose one or more from the 3 X 3 matrix to show interest, and please save the result as json, like {"sunglass": ["https://xxx.xxx.xx/sunglass.png", "https://xx.xx.xx/xx.mp4", ...]}
